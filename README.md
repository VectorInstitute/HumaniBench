## 🧠 Overview

As multimodal generative AI systems become increasingly integrated into human-centered applications, evaluating their **alignment with human values** has become critical.

**HumaniBench** is the **first comprehensive benchmark** designed to evaluate **Large Multimodal Models (LMMs)** on **seven Human-Centered AI (HCAI) principles**:

* **Fairness**
* **Ethics**
* **Understanding**
* **Reasoning**
* **Language Inclusivity**
* **Empathy**
* **Robustness**

This repository provides code and scripts for evaluating LMMs across **7 human-aligned tasks**.

## 📦 Features

* 📷 **32,000+ Real-World Image–Question Pairs**
* ✅ **Human-Verified Ground Truth Annotations**
* 🌐 **Multilingual QA Support (10+ languages)**
* 🧠 **Open and Closed-Ended VQA Formats**
* 🧪 **Visual Robustness & Bias Stress Testing**
* 📑 **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning + Perceptual Grounding**

## 📂 Evaluation Tasks Overview

| Task                               | Focus                                                                                          | Folder                             |
| :--------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| **Task 1: Scene Understanding**    | Visual reasoning + bias/toxicity analysis in social attributes (gender, age, occupation, etc.) | `code/task1_Scene_Understanding`   |
| **Task 2: Instance Identity**      | Visual reasoning in culturally rich, socially grounded settings                                | `code/task2_Instance_Identity`     |
| **Task 3: Multiple Choice QA**     | Structured attribute recognition via multi-choice questions                                    | `code/task3_Multiple_Choice_VQA`   |
| **Task 4: Multilingual Visual QA** | VQA across 10+ languages, including low-resource ones                                          | `code/task4_Multilingual`          |
| **Task 5: Visual Grounding**       | Bounding box localization of socially salient regions                                          | `code/task5_Visual_Grounding`      |
| **Task 6: Empathetic Captioning**  | Human-style emotional captioning evaluation                                                    | `code/task6_Empathetic_Captioning` |
| **Task 7: Image Resilience**       | Robustness testing via image perturbations                                                     | `code/task7_Image_Resilience`      |

> 🔍 Each task folder includes a README with setup instructions, task structure, and metrics.

## 🧬 Pipeline

**Three-stage process:**

1. **Data Collection**
   Curated from global news imagery, tagged by social attributes (age, gender, race, occupation, sport)

2. **Annotation**
   GPT-4o–assisted labeling + human expert verification

3. **Evaluation**
   Comprehensive scoring across:

   * Accuracy
   * Fairness
   * Robustness
   * Empathy
   * Faithfulness

---

## 🔑 Key Insights

* 🔍 **Bias persists**, especially across gender and race
* 🌐 **Multilingual gaps** affect low-resource language performance
* ❤️ **Empathy and ethics** vary significantly by model family
* 🧠 **Chain-of-Thought reasoning** improves performance but doesn’t fully mitigate bias
* 🧪 **Robustness tests** reveal fragility to noise, occlusion, and blur
